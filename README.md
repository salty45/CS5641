# CS5641 Final Project
Repo for CS5641 VR class project

The main project of the castle is located in the sun_split folder in the file 'sun_split' if you want to download and run it.

The secondary project of the AR interaction is in 'sage_pilot'.  It has an option to uncomment two lines to also run it in server mode with nutritious_pancake.

References for the client / server mode were the <a href = https://processing.org/reference/libraries/net/index.html> Network library</a>.
